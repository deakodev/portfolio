![Echo Logging Library](/(echo)/echo.jpg)

## Overview

Echo is a modern logging library for OCaml that provides type-safe, structured logging capabilities. Built with functional programming principles, it offers a clean API for application logging with support for multiple output handlers, log levels, and structured data formatting.

## Key Features

### Type-Safe Logging

- Strongly-typed logging API that prevents common logging errors at compile time
- Support for structured logging with key-value pairs
- Compile-time log level filtering for zero-cost abstractions

### Flexible Output Handlers

- Console output with colorized formatting
- File-based logging with rotation support
- Custom handler support for integration with external systems
- Configurable formatting (JSON, plain text, custom formats)

### Performance

- Zero-cost abstractions when log levels are disabled
- Efficient string formatting and buffering
- Minimal runtime overhead

## Architecture

**Language:** OCaml with functional programming patterns

**Core Components:**
- Logger module with type-safe API
- Handler system for output routing
- Formatter system for log message formatting
- Configuration module for runtime setup

## Use Cases

- Application debugging and monitoring
- Production logging with structured data
- Development tooling and diagnostics
- Integration with logging aggregation services

## Example Usage

```ocaml
open Echo

let logger = Logger.create ~name:"my_app" ()

let () =
  Logger.info logger "Application started" [];
  Logger.debug logger "Processing request" 
    [("user_id", Int 123); ("path", String "/api/data")];
  Logger.error logger "Failed to connect" 
    [("error", String "Connection timeout")]
```
