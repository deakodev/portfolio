## Overview

A Python implementation of maze generation using the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with real-time visualization. This project demonstrates recursive backtracking to create perfect mazes, guaranteeing exactly one unique path between any two points.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Backtracking:** Classic DFS algorithm implementation
- **Perfect Mazes:** Single unique path between any two points
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Step-by-step animation with color-coded cells
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjustable speed and regeneration
- **Flexible Configuration:** Customizable grid sizes and cell shapes
- **Export Functionality:** Save generated mazes for later use

## How It Works

The algorithm starts with an unvisited grid and recursively:

1. Marks the current cell as visited
2. Randomly selects an unvisited neighbor
3. Removes the wall between cells
4. Recursively continues from the neighbor
5. Backtracks when no unvisited neighbors remain

This process continues until all cells are visited, creating a perfect maze with guaranteed connectivity.

## Use Cases

- Algorithm visualization and education
- Procedural level generation for games
- Pathfinding algorithm testing
