## Overview

A visual implementation of maze generation using the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This project demonstrates the classic recursive backtracking approach to creating perfect mazes, with real-time visualization of the generation process.

## Key Features

### Algorithm Implementation

- **Recursive Backtracking:** Classic DFS maze generation algorithm
- **Perfect Mazes:** Guarantees a single unique path between any two points
- **Configurable Grid Size:** Adjustable maze dimensions
- **Multiple Generation Modes:** Support for different maze styles and patterns

### Visualization

- Real-time rendering of maze generation process
- Step-by-step animation showing the algorithm's progress
- Color-coded visualization of visited cells, current path, and walls
- Interactive controls for speed adjustment and regeneration

### Technical Details

- Efficient data structures for grid representation
- Optimized rendering for smooth animations
- Support for different cell shapes (square, hexagonal, etc.)
- Export functionality for generated mazes

## Algorithm Explanation

The depth-first search maze generation algorithm works by:

1. Starting with a grid of cells, all initially unvisited
2. Choosing a starting cell and marking it as visited
3. Randomly selecting an unvisited neighbor
4. Removing the wall between the current cell and the chosen neighbor
5. Recursively continuing from the neighbor
6. When no unvisited neighbors exist, backtracking to find new paths
7. Continuing until all cells are visited

This process creates a perfect maze with exactly one path between any two points.
