## Overview

Enpass is a lightweight, command-line password manager designed for developers and terminal users who prefer a fast, secure way to manage their credentials without leaving the command line. Built with security and simplicity in mind, it provides encryption, secure storage, and an intuitive CLI interface.

## Key Features

### Security

- **Strong Encryption:** Uses industry-standard encryption (AES-256) for password storage
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 or Argon2 for key derivation from master password
- **Secure Storage:** Encrypted vault file with authenticated encryption
- **No Cloud Dependency:** All data stored locally, under your control

### Command-Line Interface

- **Simple Commands:** Intuitive CLI for common operations
- **Quick Access:** Fast password retrieval and generation
- **Search Functionality:** Efficient search across stored credentials
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Secure password copying with auto-clear

### Password Management

- **Password Generation:** Configurable password generator with various options
- **Category Organization:** Organize passwords by categories (websites, apps, etc.)
- **Metadata Support:** Store additional information (usernames, URLs, notes)
- **Import/Export:** Support for importing from other password managers

## Core Commands

```bash
# Add a new password entry
enpass add example.com

# Retrieve a password
enpass get example.com

# Generate a new password
enpass generate --length 20 --symbols

# List all entries
enpass list

# Search entries
enpass search "github"

# Update an entry
enpass update example.com
```

## Architecture

**Security Model:**
- Master password used to derive encryption key
- Encrypted vault file stored locally
- Memory-safe password handling
- Secure deletion of sensitive data

**Storage Format:**
- Encrypted JSON or binary format
- Support for multiple vault files
- Backup and sync capabilities

## Use Cases

- Developer workflow integration
- Server and infrastructure credential management
- Automated script credential access
- Terminal-first user experience

## Security Considerations

- Master password never stored or transmitted
- Encryption keys derived using secure key derivation functions
- Passwords cleared from memory after use
- Secure file permissions on vault storage
