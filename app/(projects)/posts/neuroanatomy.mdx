## Overview

This project bridges neuroimaging and physical fabrication to create an interactive, haptic learning tool for neuroanatomy. By converting a T1-weighted MRI slice into a 3D-embossed tactile map with conductive landmarks, the system enables game-based learning inspired by _Operation_, promoting spatial understanding through touch and immediate feedback.

**Source data:** T1-weighted sagittal MRI from a healthy 20-year-old female ([case 37605](https://radiopaedia.org/cases/37605))

## Workflow Summary

### 1. **DICOM/PNG to 3D Model**

You can begin with a DICOM slice or a PNG image. If starting from DICOM, load the study into your prefered medical imaging software (eg, 3D Slicer) and export the desired slice as a PNG. Ensure 16-bit grayscale for maximum depth information.

**Source options for free medical imaging:**

- **The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)**  
  Free, de-identified clinical datasets across CT, MRI, PET, and more.  
  https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net

- **3D Slicer Sample Data (QIICR)**  
  Small, high quality DICOM datasets ideal for testing and teaching.  
  https://sampledata.slicer.org

- **Radiopaedia Cases (some with DICOM downloads)**  
  Not all cases include DICOM, but many do.

**PNG to 3D Model** (Blender):

- Import PNG as image texture in Blender
- Create plane mesh and apply UV mapping
- Add material with displacement/bump node using PNG as input
- Apply modifiers to mesh:
  - **Subdivision Surface:** Level 2 (Catmull-Clark) for smooth topology
  - **Displace:** Strength 1.5–2.0 mm, texture coordinate set to UV
  - **Solidify:** 10 mm thickness for structural integrity
- Export as high-resolution STL for fabrication

### 2. **CNC Fabrication**

- **Material:** ¾″ maple board (16″ × 16″)
- **Roughing pass:** ¼″ flat-end bit, 3 mm stepdown
- **Finishing pass:** ⅛″ ball-end bit for fine detail
- **Duration:** ~12 hours
- **Post-processing:** Sanding up to 220 grint, stain and oil finish

### 3. **Interactive Electronics** (In Progress)

- Identify 32 key anatomical landmarks (e.g., corpus callosum, thalamus, cerebellar vermis)
- Drill holes and insert 8-gauge copper wire at each landmark
- Connect to Arduino Uno circuit for stylus-contact detection
- Provide feedback via piezo buzzer and 16×2 LCD (displays structure name)
